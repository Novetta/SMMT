# SMMT
The Supermicro Monitoring Tool (SMMT) automatically installs, configures, and utilizes Supermicro (SM) software to monitor the health of Linux systems running on SM hardware. Other hardware brands like HP have built-in utilities for this, but SM does not. SMMT automatically checks for active RAID controllers and hard drives in a machine and reports their health to the user (via email, if desired). Email addresses must be specified in the script, if email alerts are utilized.
